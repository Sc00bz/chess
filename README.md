# Chessbot3000

You need DejaVu Sans Mono, in a ttf named "dejavumr.ttf" for the chess
pieces.

You need an env var BOT_TOKEN with the Slack API token of a user named
"chessbot3000".

You need to change the URL in chessbot to not point to my server. Yes,
of course the URL should be an env var. Yes, of course the name of the
bot should be an env var.

There is virtually no error reporting. This is slop. Enjoy.
